# Radio Image Telescop project

## Introduction

The Radio Telescope utilises a Satelite Dish to scan the night sky controlled with an Embedded interface that communicates with a client. The Embedded Interface transmits the information gathered to the client. After the scan is finished and all the information is transmitted, the client creates an image from the received radio frequencies.
